# Simple Timing & Program Control

Timing control is crucial in LabVIEW programming. Without proper timing, your programs can consume excessive CPU resources, become unresponsive, or execute too fast for meaningful interaction. This lesson teaches you the essential timing functions and when to use them.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of LabVIEW loops (For and While Loops)
- Basic knowledge of block diagram programming

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand why timing is essential in LabVIEW programs
- Use basic timing functions effectively
- Implement proper timing in loops
- Measure elapsed time for performance analysis
- Create timed sequences and delays

## Why Timing Matters

### The Problem: Runaway Loops

Without timing controls, LabVIEW loops execute as fast as possible:

```vhdl
// BAD EXAMPLE - No timing
While Loop:
  Update display
  Read sensor
  Check stop condition
// This loop will consume 100% CPU!
```

**Consequences:**
- **100% CPU usage** - Computer becomes sluggish
- **UI becomes unresponsive** - Hard to interact with controls
- **Excessive power consumption** - Drains battery quickly
- **Overheating** - CPU runs hot unnecessarily

### The Solution: Controlled Timing

```vhdl
// GOOD EXAMPLE - Proper timing
While Loop:
  Update display
  Read sensor  
  Wait (ms) ← 100 ms delay
  Check stop condition
// Loop now executes 10 times per second
```

**Benefits:**
- **Controlled execution rate** - Predictable performance
- **CPU efficiency** - Allows other programs to run
- **Responsive UI** - Controls remain interactive
- **Power savings** - Better battery life

## LabVIEW Timing Functions

LabVIEW provides several timing functions in the **Programming → Timing** palette:

### 1. Wait (ms) - Basic Delay

**Purpose:** Pause program execution for a specified time

**When to use:**
- Adding delays between operations
- Controlling loop execution rate
- Creating timeouts

**Example: Temperature Logger**
```vhdl
While Loop:
  Read temperature sensor
  Update chart
  Wait (ms) ← 1000  // Wait 1 second
  Check stop button
// Results in 1 reading per second
```

> 💡 **Best Practice**  
> Use 10-100 ms delays in UI loops for responsive yet efficient operation.

### 2. Wait Until Next ms Multiple - Synchronized Timing

**Purpose:** Wait until the system clock reaches the next multiple of a specified interval

**When to use:**
- Synchronizing multiple loops
- Creating precise periodic timing
- Data acquisition at specific intervals

**Example: Synchronized Data Collection**
```vhdl
Loop 1:
  Collect Channel 1 data
  Wait Until Next ms Multiple ← 50
  
Loop 2:  
  Collect Channel 2 data
  Wait Until Next ms Multiple ← 50
// Both loops execute synchronized every 50ms
```

**Key Difference from Wait (ms):**
- **Wait (ms)**: Waits FOR a duration
- **Wait Until Next ms Multiple**: Waits UNTIL a specific time

### 3. Tick Count (ms) - Time Measurement

**Purpose:** Returns the current system time in milliseconds

**When to use:**
- Measuring elapsed time
- Creating custom timers
- Performance profiling

**Example: Execution Time Measurement**
```vhdl
Start Time ← Tick Count (ms)

// Your code to measure here
Process data
Perform calculations

End Time ← Tick Count (ms)
Elapsed Time ← End Time - Start Time
```

### 4. Time Delay (Express VI) - Seconds-Based Delay

**Purpose:** Wait for a specified number of seconds (Express VI version)

**Configuration:** Set delay time in seconds through dialog

**When to use:**
- Simple delays in Express VI applications
- When working primarily with Express VIs
- Educational examples

## Practical Timing Applications

### Application 1: Data Acquisition Loop

```vhdl
Front Panel:
- Sample Rate (Hz) - numeric control
- Stop Acquisition - Boolean control
- Data Display - waveform chart

Block Diagram:
Calculate Delay ← 1000 / Sample Rate (convert Hz to ms)

While Loop:
  Acquire Data Sample
  Update Chart
  Wait (ms) ← Delay
  Stop Acquisition → Conditional Terminal
```

### Application 2: Blinking LED

```vhdl
Front Panel:
- Blink Rate (Hz) - numeric control  
- LED - Boolean indicator
- Stop - Boolean control

Block Diagram:
Blink Period ← 500 / Blink Rate  // Half period for on/off

While Loop:
  LED ← TRUE
  Wait (ms) ← Blink Period
  LED ← FALSE  
  Wait (ms) ← Blink Period
  Stop → Conditional Terminal
```

### Application 3: Timeout Implementation

```vhdl
Front Panel:
- Timeout (seconds) - numeric control
- Process Running - Boolean indicator
- Status - string indicator

Block Diagram:
Start Time ← Tick Count (ms)
Timeout ms ← Timeout × 1000

While Loop:
  Current Time ← Tick Count (ms)
  Elapsed ← Current Time - Start Time
  
  Case Structure (Elapsed >= Timeout ms):
    TRUE: 
      Status ← "Timeout occurred"
      Process Running ← FALSE
      TRUE → Loop Stop
    FALSE:
      Continue processing
      Process Running ← TRUE
      
  Wait (ms) ← 10
```

## Advanced Timing Concepts

### Measuring Performance

Create a simple performance timer SubVI:

**Timer.vi Inputs:**
- Reset Timer (Boolean)

**Timer.vi Outputs:**  
- Elapsed Time (ms) (numeric)

**Implementation:**
```vhdl
Case Structure (Reset Timer):
  TRUE:
    Start Time ← Tick Count (ms)
    Elapsed Time ← 0
  FALSE:
    Current Time ← Tick Count (ms)  
    Elapsed Time ← Current Time - Start Time

Use Shift Register to store Start Time between calls
```

### Multiple Timer Management

For applications needing multiple independent timers:

```vhdl
Timer Array ← Initialize Array (Number of Timers)

For Loop (Number of Timers):
  Current Timer ← Index Array (Timer Array, i)
  
  Case Structure (Timer Active):
    TRUE:
      Update elapsed time
      Check if expired
    FALSE:  
      Timer remains idle
      
  Replace Array Element (updated timer)
```

## Common Timing Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Standard UI Loop

```vhdl
// Recommended for most user interface loops
While Loop:
  Read user controls
  Update calculations  
  Update displays
  Wait (ms) ← 50        // 20 Hz update rate
  Check exit condition
```

### Pattern 2: High-Speed Data Collection

```vhdl
// For time-critical data acquisition
While Loop:
  Read sensor (fast)
  Store in buffer
  Wait Until Next ms Multiple ← 1  // 1 kHz
  Check buffer full or stop
```

### Pattern 3: Background Processing

```vhdl
// For non-time-critical background tasks  
While Loop:
  Process data chunk
  Update progress
  Wait (ms) ← 200      // 5 Hz, low priority
  Check completion
```

## Timing Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Delay

| Application Type | Recommended Delay | Update Rate |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **User Interface** | 50-100 ms | 10-20 Hz |
| **Data Visualization** | 25-50 ms | 20-40 Hz |
| **Control Systems** | 1-10 ms | 100-1000 Hz |
| **Background Tasks** | 100-500 ms | 2-10 Hz |
| **File Operations** | 10-100 ms | Variable |

### Performance Guidelines

**Do:**
- ✅ Always include timing in continuous loops
- ✅ Choose delays appropriate for your application
- ✅ Use shift registers for time-based calculations
- ✅ Profile performance-critical sections

**Don't:**
- ❌ Run loops without any timing (CPU hog)
- ❌ Use extremely short delays (&lt1 ms) unnecessarily
- ❌ Block the UI thread with long operations
- ❌ Ignore the impact of timing on system performance

## Common Timing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: No Timing in Loops

```vhdl
// WRONG - Burns CPU
While Loop:
  Update display
  Check buttons
  // No timing - runs at maximum speed!
```

### Mistake 2: Inappropriate Delay Values

```vhdl
// WRONG - Too fast for UI
While Loop:
  Update user interface
  Wait (ms) ← 1  // 1000 Hz is overkill for UI!
  
// WRONG - Too slow for control
While Loop:
  Read sensor for PID control
  Wait (ms) ← 1000  // 1 Hz is too slow for control!
```

### Mistake 3: Timing in Wrong Location

```vhdl
// WRONG - Timing affects data accuracy
While Loop:
  Start Time ← Tick Count (ms)
  Wait (ms) ← 100  // This affects the measurement!
  End Time ← Tick Count (ms)
  // Elapsed time will always be >= 100 ms
```

## Practice Exercises

Create a simple stopwatch VI:
- Start/Stop button (Boolean)
- Reset button (Boolean)  
- Elapsed Time display (numeric, in seconds)

- Process data in a loop
- Count iterations per second
- Display current and average rates
- Show performance statistics

## Summary
