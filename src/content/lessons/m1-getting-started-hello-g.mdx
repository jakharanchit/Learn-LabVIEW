# Your First VI – "Hello G"

Create your first LabVIEW Virtual Instrument (VI) and discover the fundamentals of graphical programming. You'll build a simple program that demonstrates controls, indicators, basic functions, and the dataflow programming paradigm that makes LabVIEW unique.

## Prerequisites

- LabVIEW installed and tour completed (previous lessons)
- Understanding of basic IDE components

## Overview

In this lesson, you'll create a VI that:
- Takes two numbers as input
- Performs a mathematical operation
- Displays the result
- Demonstrates proper LabVIEW programming style

This simple program will introduce you to the core concepts that power all LabVIEW applications.

## Understanding LabVIEW Terminology

Before we begin, let's clarify some key terms:

- **VI (Virtual Instrument)** - A LabVIEW program
- **Front Panel** - The user interface
- **Block Diagram** - The code/logic
- **Control** - Input from user (data source)
- **Indicator** - Output to user (data sink)
- **Terminal** - Block diagram representation of front panel objects
- **Wire** - Data connection between terminals
- **Function** - Built-in operation (Add, Multiply, etc.)

## Step 1: Create a New VI

1. Launch LabVIEW
2. In the **Getting Started** window, click **Blank VI**
3. You'll see two windows open:
   - **Front Panel** - currently empty
   - **Block Diagram** - also empty

> 💡 **Tip**  
> Use **Ctrl+E** to quickly switch between the front panel and block diagram.

## Step 2: Design the Front Panel

### Adding Input Controls

1. Make sure the **front panel** is active (click on it)
2. Right-click in empty space to open the **Controls palette**
3. Navigate to **Modern → Numeric**
4. Select **Numeric Control** 
5. Click to place it on the front panel
6. **Double-click** the label and rename it to **"First Number"**
7. Repeat to add a second **Numeric Control** labeled **"Second Number"**

### Adding an Output Indicator

1. From **Modern → Numeric**, select **Numeric Indicator**
2. Place it on the front panel
3. Label it **"Result"**

### Adding a Control Button

1. Navigate to **Modern → Boolean**
2. Select **OK Button**
3. Place it on the front panel
4. Label it **"Calculate"**

Your front panel should now look organized with two inputs, one output, and a button.

## Step 3: Build the Block Diagram

### Understanding Terminals

1. Switch to the **block diagram** (Ctrl+E)
2. Notice the **terminals** corresponding to your front panel objects:
   - **Controls** have thick borders with arrows pointing right (data sources)
   - **Indicators** have thin borders with arrows pointing left (data sinks)

### Adding the Add Function

1. Right-click in empty space to open the **Functions palette**
2. Navigate to **Programming → Numeric**
3. Select the **Add** function
4. Place it between your control and indicator terminals

### Wiring the Circuit

Now comes the exciting part - connecting everything with wires!

1. Select the **Wiring tool** from the Tools palette (or it may auto-select)
2. Click on the **First Number** terminal (data flows out)
3. Click on the **left input** of the Add function
4. Wire the **Second Number** terminal to the **right input** of the Add function
5. Wire the **output** of the Add function to the **Result** indicator terminal

> ✅ **Best Practice**  
> Wires should be neat and avoid crossing when possible. Use the spacebar while wiring to change wire direction.

### Understanding Wire Colors

Different data types have different colored wires:
- **Orange** - Floating-point numbers (DBL)
- **Blue** - Integers (I32)  
- **Green** - Boolean (True/False)
- **Pink** - Strings (text)

## Step 4: Run and Test Your VI

### Running the Program

1. Return to the **front panel** (Ctrl+E)
2. Enter values in both numeric controls (e.g., 5 and 3)
3. Click the **Run** button (arrow) in the toolbar
4. Observe the result appear in the indicator

### The Run Button States

- **Solid arrow** - VI is ready to run
- **Broken arrow** - VI has errors and cannot run
- **Running arrow** - VI is currently executing

## Step 5: Understanding Dataflow

### What Just Happened?

When you ran the VI:
1. Data flowed from the controls through their terminals
2. The Add function waited until it received data on both inputs
3. Once both inputs had data, the function executed
4. The result flowed to the indicator terminal and appeared on the front panel

This is **dataflow programming** - functions execute when their input data is available, not based on sequential lines of code.

### Dataflow Rules

- A function executes only when **all** its inputs have data
- Data flows immediately from outputs to connected inputs
- Multiple functions can execute simultaneously if their data is ready
- No function executes until its input requirements are met

## Step 6: Enhance Your VI

### Add More Functionality

Let's make the VI more interesting by adding additional operations:

1. **Block diagram**: Add **Subtract**, **Multiply**, and **Divide** functions
2. **Front panel**: Add corresponding indicators for each result
3. Wire all operations to use the same two input controls
4. Run the VI to see all results simultaneously

### Adding Error Handling

1. Add a **Divide by Zero** check using the **Equal?** function
2. Compare the second number to zero
3. Use a **Boolean indicator** to warn when division by zero occurs

## Step 7: Save Your Work

### Proper VI Naming

1. **File → Save** (Ctrl+S)
2. Navigate to your work directory
3. Name it **"Hello G.vi"**
4. Click **Save**

> ⚠️ **Important**  
> Always save VIs with descriptive names and in organized folders. Avoid spaces in filenames for compatibility.

## Step 8: Document Your VI

### Adding VI Description

1. **File → VI Properties**
2. Go to **Documentation** tab
3. Add a description: *"My first LabVIEW VI - demonstrates basic math operations"*
4. Add your name as the author
5. Click **OK**

### Labeling Objects

1. Right-click on any front panel object
2. Select **Properties**
3. In **Documentation** tab, add descriptions
4. These appear in Context Help when you hover over objects

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. Broken Wires
**Problem**: Trying to wire incompatible data types  
**Solution**: Check wire colors and use conversion functions if needed

### 2. Unwired Inputs
**Problem**: Function won't execute because an input is missing  
**Solution**: Ensure all required inputs are wired or use default values

### 3. Backwards Wiring
**Problem**: Trying to wire from indicator to control  
**Solution**: Remember dataflow - data flows from sources (controls) to sinks (indicators)

### 4. Missing Error Handling
**Problem**: VI stops unexpectedly on errors  
**Solution**: Add basic error checking, especially for division operations

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Temperature Converter
Create a VI that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32

### Exercise 2: Circle Calculator
Build a VI that calculates area and circumference of a circle given its radius.

### Exercise 3: Boolean Logic
Create a VI with two Boolean controls and show the results of AND, OR, and XOR operations.

## Keyboard Shortcuts Learned

| Shortcut | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Ctrl+E** | Switch between front panel and block diagram |
| **Ctrl+S** | Save VI |
| **Ctrl+R** | Run VI |
| **Ctrl+.** | Abort VI execution |
| **Tab** | Cycle through tools |
| **Space** | Toggle between Operating and Positioning tools |

## Key Programming Concepts

### Controls vs Indicators
- **Controls** provide input data (thick border terminals)
- **Indicators** display output data (thin border terminals)
- Data flows from controls to indicators, never the reverse

### Functions and Wiring
- Functions perform operations on data
- All required inputs must be wired before execution
- Outputs immediately provide data to connected wires

### Dataflow Execution
- No sequential execution like text-based languages
- Functions execute when input data is available
- Multiple functions can run simultaneously
- Natural parallelism without threading complexity

## Troubleshooting Guide

### "My VI won't run!"
1. Check for **broken run arrow**
2. Open **Error List** window (Windows → Error List)
3. Fix wiring errors or missing connections

### "Nothing happens when I run!"
1. Verify all function inputs are wired
2. Check that controls have values entered
3. Ensure data types are compatible

### "Wires look broken!"
1. **Edit → Remove Broken Wires**
2. Re-wire connections carefully
3. Check data type compatibility

## Best Practices Established

1. **Organize the front panel** logically with inputs on left, outputs on right
2. **Label everything** clearly and descriptively  
3. **Keep wiring neat** - avoid crossed wires when possible
4. **Save frequently** with meaningful names
5. **Test thoroughly** with various input values
6. **Document your work** for future reference

## Summary
