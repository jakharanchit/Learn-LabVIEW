# Loop & Case Structures 101

Programming structures are the building blocks that control how your LabVIEW programs execute. This lesson introduces the three most essential structures: For Loops, While Loops, and Case Structures.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of LabVIEW data types and wiring
- Basic familiarity with the block diagram environment

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand when to use For Loops vs While Loops
- Know how to wire conditional logic with Case Structures
- Control data flow in and out of structures
- Implement basic iteration and decision-making in your VIs

## Programming Structures Overview

LabVIEW provides several structures to control program execution:

1. **For Loops** - Execute a set number of times
2. **While Loops** - Execute until a condition is met  
3. **Case Structures** - Execute different code based on conditions
4. **Sequence Structures** - Control execution order
5. **Event Structures** - Respond to user interactions (advanced)

Today we'll focus on the first three, which handle 90% of programming logic needs.

## For Loops: Counting Made Easy

The **For Loop** executes its contents a specific number of times, determined by the count terminal.

### For Loop Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  [N] ←── Count      │
│                     │
│   Your code here    │
│                     │
│  [i] ←── Iteration  │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Key Terminals:**
- **Count (N)**: Number of iterations (input)
- **Iteration (i)**: Current iteration number (output, 0-based)

### How For Loops Work

1. **Before execution**: LabVIEW reads the count terminal
2. **During execution**: Loop runs from i=0 to i=(N-1)
3. **After execution**: Data exits through tunnel(s)

### For Loop Example: Array Generation

```
Front Panel:
- Array Size (numeric control)
- Random Array (numeric array indicator)

Block Diagram:
Array Size → For Loop Count
             Inside loop: Random Number (0-1) → Auto-indexing tunnel
                         Loop generates one random number per iteration
```

> 💡 **Key Insight**  
> For Loops are perfect when you know exactly how many times something should happen.

## While Loops: Conditional Execution

The **While Loop** continues executing until a Boolean condition is met.

### While Loop Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   Your code here    │
│                     │
│  [Stop?] ←── Cond   │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Key Terminals:**
- **Conditional**: Boolean input that controls loop continuation
- **Iteration**: Current iteration count (optional output)

### While Loop Modes

**Stop if True (Default):**
- Loop continues while condition is FALSE
- Stops when condition becomes TRUE

**Continue if True:**
- Loop continues while condition is TRUE  
- Stops when condition becomes FALSE

> ⚠️ **Important**  
> While Loops check the conditional terminal at the END of each iteration, so they always execute at least once!

### While Loop Example: User-Controlled Data Acquisition

```
Front Panel:
- Stop Button (Boolean control)
- Temperature Reading (numeric indicator)

Block Diagram:
While Loop {
    Acquire Temperature → Temperature Reading
    Stop Button → Conditional Terminal (Stop if True)
}
```

## Case Structures: Decision Making

The **Case Structure** executes different code based on the value of a selector input.

### Case Structure Anatomy

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ [Selector] ←── Input│
│                     │
│   Case 0 code here  │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Key Features:**
- **Selector terminal**: Determines which case executes
- **Multiple cases**: Add cases for different values
- **Default case**: Handles unspecified values

### Case Structure Types

**Boolean Case Structure:**
- Two cases: TRUE and FALSE
- Selector wired to Boolean data

**Numeric Case Structure:**
- Multiple cases based on numbers
- Can specify ranges (e.g., 0..10)

**String Case Structure:**
- Cases based on text values
- Useful for parsing commands

### Case Structure Example: Simple Calculator

```
Front Panel:
- Number A, Number B (numeric controls)
- Operation (string control: "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply", "Divide")
- Result (numeric indicator)

Block Diagram:
Operation → Case Structure Selector
Cases:
  "Add": A + B → Result
  "Subtract": A - B → Result  
  "Multiply": A × B → Result
  "Divide": A ÷ B → Result
```

## Tunnels: Data In and Out of Structures

Data passes through structure boundaries via **tunnels** - small squares on the structure border.

### Tunnel Types

**Input Tunnels:**
- Solid squares
- Bring data INTO the structure
- Data available throughout all iterations

**Output Tunnels:**
- Hollow squares initially
- Carry data OUT of the structure
- Must be wired in ALL cases (Case Structures)

**Auto-Indexing Tunnels (For Loops):**
- Automatically build arrays
- Square with thick border
- Each iteration adds one element

### Auto-Indexing Example

```
For Loop (Count = 5):
  Random Number → Auto-indexing output tunnel
  
Result: Array with 5 random numbers
```

## Practical Applications

### Data Logger with User Control

```vhdl
Front Panel:
- Log Data (Boolean - TRUE to start)
- Stop Logging (Boolean - TRUE to stop)  
- Sample Rate (numeric)
- Data Log (array indicator)

Block Diagram:
While Loop {
    Case Structure (Log Data selector):
      TRUE case: 
        - Acquire data sample
        - Add to array
      FALSE case:
        - Do nothing (just wait)
    
    Wait (Sample Rate)
    Stop Logging → Loop conditional
}
```

### Array Processing with Conditional Logic

```vhdl
Front Panel:
- Input Array (numeric array)
- Processing Mode (string: "Sum", "Average", "Max")
- Result (numeric indicator)

Block Diagram:
For Loop (auto-sized by Input Array):
  Index Array → Current Element
  
  Case Structure (Processing Mode):
    "Sum": Add elements using shift register
    "Average": Sum and divide by array size
    "Max": Compare and keep maximum
```

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

### The Classic "Process Until Done" Pattern

```vhdl
Initialize variables
While Loop:
  Do some work
  Check if finished → Stop condition
```

### The "State Machine" Foundation

```vhdl
Current State → Case Structure:
  "Initialize": Setup → Next State = "Acquire"
  "Acquire": Get data → Next State = "Process"  
  "Process": Analyze → Next State = "Display"
  "Display": Show results → Next State = "Acquire" or "Stop"
```

### Error Handling Integration

```vhdl
While Loop:
  Case Structure (Error occurred?):
    FALSE: Normal operation
    TRUE: Handle error, set stop condition
```

## Performance Considerations

### Loop Timing

**Always include timing in continuous loops:**
```vhdl
While Loop:
  Your code here
  Wait (ms) ← 10-100 ms typical
  Stop condition
```

**Without timing:**
- Loops consume 100% CPU
- UI becomes unresponsive
- System performance degrades

### Memory Management

**Arrays in loops:**
- Pre-allocate when possible
- Use shift registers for running calculations
- Avoid building large arrays unnecessarily

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

❌ **Infinite While Loops**
```vhdl
// Stop button outside loop - WRONG!
Stop Button
While Loop:
  Do work
  TRUE → Conditional (never changes!)
```

✅ **Proper Stop Control**
```vhdl
While Loop:
  Do work
  Stop Button → Conditional (read inside loop)
```

❌ **Uninitialized Case Structure Outputs**
```vhdl
Case Structure:
  Case 0: Wire to output
  Case 1: Nothing wired - BROKEN!
```

✅ **All Cases Wired**
```vhdl
Case Structure:
  Case 0: Value A → Output
  Case 1: Value B → Output
  Default: Default Value → Output
```

❌ **Wrong Loop Type**
```vhdl
// Need exactly 10 iterations
While Loop with counter - COMPLEX!
```

✅ **Right Tool for the Job**
```vhdl
For Loop (Count = 10) - SIMPLE!
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Number Generator
Create a VI that generates a specified number of random values:
- Use a For Loop with count from front panel control
- Generate random numbers between 0-100
- Display results in an array indicator

### Exercise 2: Temperature Monitor  
Build a continuous temperature monitoring system:
- Use a While Loop for continuous operation
- Simulate temperature with random values (0-50°C)
- Include a stop button for user control
- Add a 1-second delay between readings

### Exercise 3: Grade Calculator
Design a grade processing system:
- Input: Student score (0-100)
- Use Case Structure to assign letter grades:
  - 90-100: "A"
  - 80-89: "B"  
  - 70-79: "C"
  - 60-69: "D"
  - Below 60: "F"

## Summary

**For Loops:**
- Use when you know the exact number of iterations
- Great for array processing and data generation
- Auto-indexing builds arrays automatically

**While Loops:**  
- Use for conditional execution
- Perfect for user-controlled processes
- Always execute at least once
- Include timing to prevent CPU hogging

**Case Structures:**
- Implement decision-making logic
- Support Boolean, numeric, and string selectors
- All cases must wire outputs to prevent broken VIs

**Best Practices:**
- Choose the right structure for your logic
- Always include timing in continuous loops
- Wire all case outputs properly
- Use meaningful case labels

These three structures form the foundation of LabVIEW programming. Master them, and you'll be able to implement sophisticated program logic with ease!
