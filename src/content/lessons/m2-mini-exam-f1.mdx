## Part B: Practical Exercise (Graded VI)

### Exercise: Temperature Monitor VI

**Objective:** Create a VI that simulates temperature monitoring with user controls and visual feedback.

**Requirements:**

1. **Front Panel Design:**
   - One numeric control labeled "Target Temperature (°C)" (range: 0-100)
   - One Boolean indicator labeled "Temperature Alert" 
   - One waveform chart labeled "Temperature History"
   - One stop button

2. **Block Diagram Logic:**
   - Use a While Loop for continuous operation
   - Generate random temperature values between 15-35°C
   - Compare current temperature with target temperature
   - Light the alert indicator when temperature exceeds target by >5°C
   - Plot temperature values on the chart
   - Include proper timing (500ms delay per iteration)
   - Implement clean stop functionality

3. **Code Quality:**
   - Use proper wiring techniques (minimal bends)
   - Include appropriate comments
   - Follow LabVIEW style guidelines
   - Ensure error-free compilation

### Grading Rubric

**Functionality (60 points)**
- [ ] VI compiles without errors (10 pts)
- [ ] While Loop operates correctly (10 pts)
- [ ] Random number generation works (10 pts)
- [ ] Temperature comparison logic functions (10 pts)
- [ ] Chart displays data properly (10 pts)

- [ ] Follows style guidelines (5 pts)

**Front Panel Design (15 points)**
- [ ] All required controls present (8 pts)
- [ ] Professional appearance (4 pts)
- [ ] Logical layout (3 pts)

### Implementation Guide

1. **Start with the Front Panel:**
   ```
   Create: Numeric Control → "Target Temperature (°C)"
   Create: Boolean Indicator → "Temperature Alert"
   Create: Waveform Chart → "Temperature History"
   Create: Stop Button
   ```

2. **Build the Block Diagram:**
   ```
   Add: While Loop
   Add: Random Number generator (0,1)
   Add: Scale to 15-35 range: Random * 20 + 15
   Add: Comparison logic for alert
   Add: Timing function (Wait 500ms)
   ```

3. **Wire Everything Together:**
   - Connect random temperature to chart
   - Wire comparison result to alert indicator
   - Include stop button in While Loop condition
   - Add appropriate timing

### Submission Instructions

1. Save your VI as "YourName_TempMonitor.vi"
2. Test the VI thoroughly before submission
3. Ensure the VI runs without errors
4. Include a brief comment describing your approach

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Forgetting the stop condition** - Always include a way to stop While Loops
- **Missing timing** - Include Wait functions to prevent excessive CPU usage
- **Broken wires** - Ensure all connections are properly made
- **Incorrect data types** - Match wire colors and types appropriately
