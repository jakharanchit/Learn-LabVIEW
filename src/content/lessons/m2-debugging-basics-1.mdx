# Probes, Execution Highlighting & Breakpoints

Effective debugging is the difference between frustration and fluency in LabVIEW. This lesson shows you how **probes**, **execution highlighting**, single-step tools, and **breakpoints** reveal exactly what your code is doing so you can fix problems fast.

## Introduction

When a VI misbehaves the culprit is often hidden data, a missed dependency, or unexpected timing. Because LabVIEW executes by dataflow, we need *data-centric* debugging tools. Probes let you *watch wires*, highlighting animates the *flow*, and breakpoints give you precise *suspension points*.

## Key Concepts

- The Toolbar’s light-bulb button turns on Execution Highlighting to animate wire bubbles.
- Probes are interactive windows that display the last value to pass through a wire.
- Single-step buttons (Step Into ▸, Step Over ▸|, Step Out ↰) advance execution one node at a time.
- Breakpoints pause execution automatically on wires, nodes or entire diagrams.
- Retain Wire Values stores last data on every wire—great for post-run inspection.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Identify the suspect area** of your diagram.
2. **Drop a Probe**
   ```text
   Tools ▸ Probe or right-click ▸ Probe
   ```
3. **Run with Highlighting** to see bubbles flow.
4. **Single-step** when you approach the faulty node.
5. **Add Breakpoint** on the node; rerun to suspend just before execution.
6. Inspect probe values, change front-panel inputs, then press *Run ▶* to continue.

### Example Diagram

```g
+––While Loop––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
| Random (0–1) → *Add* → Probe ➜ Chart |
+–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––+
```  
Place a breakpoint on *Add* and observe how the chart stops updating until you resume.

## Best Practices

> 💡 **Breakpoint Placement**: Break on a wire, not just the node, when you need to capture post-execution values.

> 🚫 **Avoid Saving Breakpoints** in production VIs—remove them before committing code.

> 🏷️ **Name Probes** to describe the signal, e.g. `Filtered Temp [C]`, so the Probe Watch Window stays readable.

## Summary

Debugging in LabVIEW is visual. Combine probes, highlighting and breakpoints to trace values, watch timing and fix your VIs with confidence.
