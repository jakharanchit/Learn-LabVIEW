# Charts, Graphs & Plot Customisation

Master LabVIEW's powerful visual display capabilities to create professional data presentations and real-time monitoring systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between charts and graphs and choose the appropriate display type
- Create and configure waveform charts for real-time data streaming
- Build XY graphs for parametric plots and scatter diagrams
- Customize plot appearance, scales, and legends
- Use multiple plots and mixed Y-axis scaling

## Charts vs. Graphs: Understanding the Difference

LabVIEW provides two main categories of visual displays:

### Charts
- **Accept single data points** and build up displays over time
- **Best for real-time monitoring** and streaming data
- **Maintain history** of previous data points
- **Update continuously** as new data arrives

### Graphs
- **Accept arrays of data** all at once
- **Best for displaying complete datasets**
- **Replace entire display** with each update
- **Faster plotting** for large datasets

> 💡 **Memory Tip**  
> **Charts** = **C**ontinuous streaming, **C**umulative history  
> **Graphs** = **G**roup of data, **G**ets replaced each time

## Waveform Charts

Waveform charts are perfect for monitoring signals that change over time.

### Basic Chart Operations

```g
// Wiring a single value to a chart
Random Number (0-1) → Waveform Chart
```

### Chart Update Modes

Charts have three update modes accessible via right-click:

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Strip Chart** | New data scrolls from right, old data shifts left | Continuous monitoring |
| **Scope Chart** | Fills buffer, then overwrites from left | Oscilloscope-like display |
| **Sweep Chart** | Vertical line sweeps across, erasing old data | Radar/sweep patterns |

### Multi-Plot Charts

Display multiple signals on one chart by bundling data:

```g
// Multiple plots using Bundle
Temperature → Bundle → Waveform Chart
Humidity ↗
```

> 📝 **Best Practice**  
> Use different colors and line styles for each plot to improve readability.

## Waveform Graphs

Waveform graphs display complete arrays of Y-values with uniform X-spacing.

### Single Plot Example

```g
// Basic sine wave
Sine Wave Generator → Waveform Graph
```

### Multiple Plot Configuration

```g
// Multiple waveforms
Array 1 → Build Array → Waveform Graph
Array 2 ↗
Array 3 ↗
```

### Time-Based Waveforms

For time-domain signals, use the **Build Waveform** function:

```g
Data Array → Build Waveform → Waveform Graph
dt (sampling rate) ↗
t0 (start time) ↗
```

## XY Graphs

XY graphs plot Y vs. X data, perfect for parametric equations, scatter plots, and non-uniform X-spacing.

### Creating Parametric Plots

```g
// Circle equation: X = cos(t), Y = sin(t)
Theta Array → Sine → Bundle → XY Graph
           → Cosine ↗
```

### Multiple XY Plots

```g
// Two separate curves
XY Data 1 → Build Array → XY Graph
XY Data 2 ↗
```

## Plot Customization

### Scale Configuration

**Autoscale Settings:**
- Right-click scale → AutoScale Y
- Set minimum/maximum values manually
- Configure logarithmic scaling

**Time Axis Formatting:**
- Right-click X-scale → Properties
- Format: Time & Date
- Choose display format

### Legend and Appearance

**Plot Legend:**
- Right-click graph → Visible Items → Plot Legend
- Change colors, line styles, and names
- Set point styles for scatter plots

**Graph Palette:**
- Right-click graph → Visible Items → Graph Palette
- Provides zoom, pan, and cursor tools
- Enable/disable user interaction

### Cursors

Add measurement cursors for precise readouts:

```g
// Programmatic cursor control
Cursor Position → Property Node → Graph Reference
```

**Cursor Types:**
- **Single cursor:** One measurement point
- **Multiple cursors:** Compare values
- **Free cursors:** User can drag anywhere
- **Lock to plot:** Cursor follows data points

## Advanced Plotting Techniques

### Mixed Signal Types

Combine different data types on one display:

```g
// Analog + Digital signals
Analog Waveform → Mixed Signal Graph
Digital Pattern ↗
```

### 3D Surface Plots

For three-dimensional data visualization:

```g
// Z = f(X,Y) surface
2D Array → 3D Surface Graph
```

### Intensity Graphs

Display matrix data as color-coded intensity:

```g
// Heat map display
2D Numeric Array → Intensity Graph
Color Table ↗
```

## Practical Example: Temperature Monitor

Let's build a comprehensive temperature monitoring system:

### Front Panel Setup
1. **Waveform Chart** - Real-time temperature display
2. **Digital Indicators** - Current, min, max values
3. **Boolean LED** - Over-temperature alarm
4. **Numeric Controls** - High/low limits

### Block Diagram Logic

```g
// Main monitoring loop
While Loop {
    Temperature Sensor → Current Temp
                      → Waveform Chart
                      → Min/Max Tracking
                      → Alarm Comparison
    Wait (ms) → 1000
}
```

### Customization Steps

1. **Chart History:** Set buffer size to 3600 points (1 hour at 1-second intervals)
2. **Y-Scale:** Set appropriate temperature range (0-100°C)
3. **Alarm Zones:** Add colored regions for normal/warning/critical
4. **Time Axis:** Configure for elapsed time display

## Common Plotting Patterns

### Real-Time Streaming
```g
// Continuous data acquisition
DAQ Read → Chart (inside While Loop)
```

### Batch Processing
```g
// Complete dataset display
Process Array → Graph (outside loop)
```

### Triggered Acquisition
```g
// Event-driven updates
Trigger Event → Acquire Data → Update Graph
```

## Performance Optimization

### For Charts
- Limit history length to prevent memory issues
- Use appropriate update rates (don't update faster than human perception ~30 Hz)
- Consider decimation for high-speed data

### For Graphs
- Pre-allocate arrays when possible
- Use appropriate data types (avoid unnecessary precision)
- Bundle multiple updates to reduce flicker

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Chart Not Updating
**Solution:** Ensure chart is inside loop and wired correctly

### Problem: Graph Shows Wrong Scale
**Solution:** Check autoscale settings and data range

### Problem: Multiple Plots Not Appearing
**Solution:** Use Build Array or Bundle functions correctly

### Problem: Poor Performance
**Solution:** Optimize update rates and buffer sizes
